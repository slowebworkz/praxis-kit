# @praxis-kit/lit

Lit adapter for praxis-kit — a Custom Element host carrying a Praxis semantic contract: styling,
variant composition, ARIA policy, and structural child validation. Not a reimplementation of native
HTML element behavior — see "What `tag` means" below.

---

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @praxis-kit/lit
```

Lit is a peer dependency:

```bash
pnpm add lit
```

---

## Usage

```ts
import { createContractComponent } from '@praxis-kit/lit'

const Button = createContractComponent({
  tag: 'button',
  name: 'Button',
  styling: {
    base: 'btn',
    variants: { size: { sm: 'btn--sm', lg: 'btn--lg' } },
    defaults: { size: 'sm' },
  },
  enforcement: { strict: 'warn' },
})

customElements.define('praxis-button', Button)
```

```html
<praxis-button size="lg">Click me</praxis-button>
```

Unlike the other adapters, `createContractComponent` returns a **Lit custom-element class**, not a
JSX-usable component — register it yourself with `customElements.define()`. Variants and the
built-in fields (`recipe`, `praxis-class`) are all plain HTML attributes; there's no props object to
spread.

This adapter targets **Light DOM composition only** — `createRenderRoot()` returns `this`, so Shadow
DOM styling (`::slotted`, etc.) and the Shadow DOM slot protocol are intentionally out of scope.

### What `tag` means

`options.tag` is the **intrinsic model** Praxis resolves ARIA roles, content-model rules, and
built-in prop normalizers against — it is not, and never was, the tag written to the DOM:

```text
Praxis intrinsic model:  button          (options.tag)
DOM host:                praxis-button   (customElements.define()'s name — the real element)
```

A concrete consequence: `<praxis-button disabled>` gets `aria-disabled="true"` from the built-in
`disabledProps` normalizer, but the browser does **not** make the custom element keyboard-inert or
form-participating — no ARIA attribute, on any element, custom or not, ever supplies real
interactive behavior. Need real button/link/input behavior? Wire it yourself (`onElement` is the
hook) — the same requirement any `role="button"` `<div>` would carry.

Two differences from the other adapters, both consequences of the model/host distinction above
rather than bugs:

- **No `as` — no tag polymorphism at all.** A custom element's DOM tag is fixed at
  `customElements.define()` time; nothing at render time can turn a `<praxis-button>` into an `<a>`.
  Setting an `as` attribute has no effect (it's filtered out before it reaches the pipeline, on both
  the DOM and SSR paths) rather than silently reinterpreting semantics for a tag the element will
  never actually be — matches `capabilities.tagPolymorphism: false` in the conformance suite. Need
  different semantics for one case? Register a second component with a different `tag`, or set
  `role` directly.
- **Variant attributes stay on the host.** Lit's reactive property system reflects them as real DOM
  attributes (`size="lg"`), unlike React/Vue where they're consumed and stripped before reaching the
  DOM.

`asChild` is not available on this adapter — Light DOM has no JSX-style slot to clone props onto.

### `renderContractToString` — not Custom Element SSR

`renderContractToString(Button, props)` serializes the **resolved contract** — the same
styling/ARIA/attribute pipeline the live element runs — as plain HTML using `options.tag`
(`<button>…</button>`, not `<praxis-button>…</praxis-button>`). It's a preview/static-HTML utility
(snapshot tests, static generation, non-interactive contexts), not a hydration mechanism: this
function has no way to know what name (if any) a caller eventually registers the class under
(`customElements.define()` happens externally, after the fact), so it can't emit a tag the browser
could ever upgrade in place even if it tried.
