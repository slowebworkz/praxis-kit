/**
 * Serializes a praxis-kit web component's **resolved contract** to an HTML string, without
 * requiring a DOM — not Custom Element SSR, and not a hydration mechanism.
 *
 * This distinction matters and is easy to get wrong: the output element is `options.tag`
 * (`<button>…</button>`, say), never the registered custom-element tag (`<praxis-button>`) —
 * `createContractComponent`'s own doc comment covers why the two are different concepts ("the
 * element Praxis models" vs. "the element actually in the DOM"). `customElements.define()` happens
 * externally, after `createContractComponent()` returns, and this function has no way to know what
 * name (if any) a caller eventually registers the class under, so there is no tag it could emit
 * that's guaranteed to match. Even if it could, the browser's Custom Element upgrade mechanism only
 * upgrades an exact tag-name match — a server-sent `<button>` can never become the live
 * `<praxis-button>` no matter what the client bundle does, so this was never a viable
 * SSR-then-upgrade path regardless of naming.
 *
 * Use this for what it actually is: previewing/testing the resolved styling + ARIA + attribute
 * pipeline as plain HTML (static generation, snapshot tests, non-interactive contexts) — not for
 * server-rendering markup you intend the live custom element to take over.
 *
 * `innerHTML` is treated as a pre-sanitized HTML string and inserted verbatim.
 * Callers are responsible for escaping any untrusted content before passing it.
