 * checks confirm the field is the right *kind* of value (object, function,
 * string), not that it satisfies its exact generic instantiation, which no
 * runtime check can ever do.
 *
 * Covers every field `FactoryOptions` itself declares — identical across
 * every adapter, since they all extend the same core type. Adapter-specific
 * additions (React's `slotComponent`/`artifact`, every adapter's own
 * `filterProps`, etc.) are passed in by the caller as extra entries.
