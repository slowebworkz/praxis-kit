/**
 * Adapter contract for the conformance suite.
 *
 * Generic parameter C is the framework's component type — e.g.
 * `ComponentType<UnknownProps>` for React, `Component<UnknownProps>` for Solid.
 * Providing it lets render() receive a properly typed value without casting.
 * Defaults to ConformanceComponent for adapters that don't need typed dispatch.
 *
 * Notes on framework-specific limitations:
 *   Solid  — asChild uses a render-function pattern (children must be
 *             `(props) => element`), incompatible with ChildSpec. Set
 *             `capabilities.asChild: false` and wire Solid-specific asChild
 *             tests in the adapter directly.
 *   Svelte — createContractComponent returns a BuiltRuntime bundle, not a
 *             component, and children are Svelte snippets. Wire Svelte tests
 *             directly against Polymorphic.svelte. ChildSpec children are
 *             serialised to an HTML string via createRawSnippet; component
 *             ChildSpec nodes are not supported and throw at runtime.
